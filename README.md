# Agile and Scrum

##Scrum Teams Attributes
Given below are the 2 attributes of the Scrum Team:

•	Scrum Team is Self-Organizing

•	Scrum Team is Cross-Functional

Self-Organized Scrum Teams are self-reliant and self- sufficient in terms of accomplishing their work without the need for external help or guidance. The teams are competent enough to adopt the best of practices to achieve their Sprint Goals.
Cross-Functional Scrum Teams are the teams having all the necessary skills and proficiency within the team to accomplish their work. These teams do not rely on anyone outside the team for completing the work items. Thus, the Scrum Team is a very creative amalgamation of different skills that are required to complete the entire work item.
Each team member may not necessarily have all the skills required to build the product but is competent in his/her area of expertise. Having said that, the team member need not be cross-functional but the team as a whole has to be.
The teams with high Self-Organization and Cross Functionality will result in high productivity and creativity.
